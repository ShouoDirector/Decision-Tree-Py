#Note that the structure of the decision tree is stored in the decision_tree object, 
#with each node represented by an object that contains either a question (if it is a non-leaf node)
# or an answer (if it is a leaf node). The children array contains the child nodes of the current node,
# and the result property is used to store the classification result for a leaf node.
